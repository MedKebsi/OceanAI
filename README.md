Welcome to the official open-source documentation and resource page for the OceanAI project.

## Getting started
This page contains all the resources and information necessary to recreate this project on your own.
### Prerequisites
* [KiCad EDA](https://www.kicad.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Autodesk Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
* [ElectricUI](https://electricui.com/)

## The Plan
The plan for OceanAI is to develop an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and use Computer Vision to identify and map objects in the ocean, while also collecting important data. Everything from the printed circuit board running our own software will be developed and posted here.
### Main things to come!
* Fully finished and optimized sub software.
* Fully trained computer vision model (still training)
* Finished submarine.
* Finished GUI
